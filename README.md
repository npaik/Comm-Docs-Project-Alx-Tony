# Overview of Git User Documentation

Welcome to the User Documentation for Git. This guide will help you understand the basics of Git, a popular version control system used for managing code and other files.

The guide is divided into three sections: 
1. Getting Started with Git
2. Git Basics
3. Git Branching

## How We Collaborated Together

During our assigned classes at school, we made key decisions regarding the structure and content of our project. We held discussions and reviewed plans, as well as demonstrated completed tasks to each other. Our communication took place both in-person and online through the messaging platform Discord. To manage our project's version control, we used Git.

## Why and How We Created Our Guide

Throughout this term at school and in our projects, we found ourselves using Git quite frequently. As we gained experience with Git, we also acquired many new skills and techniques.

However, we recognized that the official Git documentation is extensive and sometimes overwhelming, especially for beginners. To help others get started with Git, we decided to create this guide. By using our personal experiences and pulling the information from [Official Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc), we transformed all collected resources into a simple, easy-to-follow format. With this guide, you can quickly learn the basics of Git version control and begin using it in your projects.

### Using MkDocs

To create the documentation, we utilized the static site generator [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). We used the [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme and installed all necessary packages through the Python package manager. Our documentation source files were written in Markdown and configured through a YAML configuration file. 

### Using VS Code

For Markdown editing and preview, we chose the VS Code IDE as our primary editor and installed two essential extensions - [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) and [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint). These extensions enabled us to write, edit, and preview our documentation in the same environment.
