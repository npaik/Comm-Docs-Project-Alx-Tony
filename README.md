# Overview of Git User Documentation

Welcome to the User Documentation for Git. This guide will help you understand the basics of Git, a popular version control system used for managing code and other files.

The guide is divided into three sections:

1. Getting Started with Git
2. Git Basics
3. Git Branching

## How We Collaborated Together

During our assigned classes at school, we made key decisions regarding the structure and content of our project. We held discussions and reviewed plans, as well as demonstrated completed tasks to each other. Our communication took place both in-person and online through the messaging platform Discord. To manage our project's version control, we used Git.

## Why and How We Created Our Guide

Throughout this term at school and in our projects, we found ourselves using Git quite frequently. As we gained experience with Git, we also acquired many new skills and techniques.

However, we recognized that the official Git documentation is extensive and sometimes overwhelming, especially for beginners. To help others get started with Git, we decided to create this guide. By using our personal experiences and pulling the information from [Official Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc), we transformed all collected resources into a simple, easy-to-follow format. With this guide, you can quickly learn the basics of Git version control and begin using it in your projects.

### Using MkDocs

To create the documentation, we utilized the static site generator [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). We used the [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme and installed all necessary packages through the Python package manager. Our documentation source files were written in Markdown and configured through a YAML configuration file.

### Using VS Code

For Markdown editing and preview, we chose the VS Code IDE as our primary editor and installed two essential extensions - [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) and [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint). These extensions enabled us to write, edit, and preview our documentation in the same environment.

## What We've Learned While Creating This Documentation

### Technical Skills

While creating this Git User Documentation, we learned various technical skills that will be useful for future documentation projects and in our careers. We gained experience with Markdown, MkDocs, and Git, which will help us create, edit, and manage documentation more efficiently:
- Understanding Markdown's essentials will help us create clear and easy-to-follow instructions for readers in the future.
- We learned how to use MkDocs to create a simple and user-friendly documentation site.
- By practicing Git, we became more comfortable with its use, which will be beneficial for future coding projects and collaborations with other developers.

### Web Writing Techniques

To make our web documentation more accessible, we used chunking to break down complex concepts and used lists to present information in an organized way. These techniques helped us create content that is easy to follow and accessible to all. Overall, our experience helped us become better writers for the web.

## Conclusion

In developing this Git User Documentation, we set out on an adventure to explore and learn about Git, a popular version control system. Our goal was to break down complex ideas into simpler terms so beginners could easily understand and use Git.

By writing this documentation, we practiced creating clear, easy-to-follow instructions for our readers. This experience has helped us become better at explaining technical subjects in a way that is approachable for everyone.

Our team's success in this project relied on strong communication and teamwork. We kept in touch, shared updates on our work, and supported each other in making sure our writing style and content were consistent and easy to understand.

Thank you for your interest in our Git User Documentation. We hope it serves as a helpful guide for both beginners and experienced users. Our aim is to provide an easy-to-use reference for learning Git and to support our own growth in future projects.
